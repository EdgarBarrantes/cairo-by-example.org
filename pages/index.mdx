# Cairo by Example

Learn [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org) and [StarkNet](https://starknet.io) Smart Contract programming with example code.

## Welcome

Welcome to "Cairo by Example", an effort to create an onboarding and reference documentation for Cairo- and StarkNet Smart Contract programmers.
